Problem Statement: Word Frequency Counter
Objective: Create an algorithm that takes a block of text as input and computes the frequency of each word in that text. The results should be stored in a data structure where each unique word is a key, and its corresponding frequency is the value.

Requirements:
Input:

A string representing a block of text. The text may contain punctuation, special characters, and varying cases (uppercase and lowercase).
Output:

A data structure (e.g., a hash table or dictionary) that contains:
Key: Each unique word from the text.
Value: The frequency of that word in the text.
Considerations:

Normalize the text by converting all characters to lowercase to ensure that "Word" and "word" are counted as the same word.
Ignore punctuation and special characters when counting words.
Handle edge cases such as:
Empty strings.
Text with no words (only punctuation).
Words that appear multiple times.
Example:

Input: "Hello, world! Hello everyone. Welcome to the world of programming."
Output:
plaintext
